* Finding the PDF of the brightness fluctuations
For the discussion of the sigma POS sigma LOS correlation, we want to see whether the emissivity fluctuations  combined with radial expansion might be contributing.

If this is the case, then sigma(POS) / sigma(LOS) ought to increase as the width of the emissivity distribution increases.

In Arthur et al (2016) we showed that the emissivity sigma is about twice the surface brightness sigma, with the later being estimated from the Ha maps.

So we will calculate it for 30 Doradus in order to compare with Orion
